For my project I created a vignette showing the retrevial of data from the Pokemon API. I created 3 functions to extract data on berries, moves and pokemon. I found it interesting working with an API and requesting and formatting data. I have often heard professors mentioning that cleaning the data is 90% of the work and the analysis is only 10%; I got to experience that first hand on this project. The most difficult part of the programming was, and still is, making sure the Json information is returned in a nice format. I had a lot of difficulty working with the lists and accessing the elements I wanted. In the future it may be better to spend more time working with multi-leveled lists to make sure I get all of the data I need.
