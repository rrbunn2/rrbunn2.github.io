##Programming Experience
I personally prefer R to other software that I have used like SAS, Python, and Microsoft SQL. I like the open source nature and the ease of accessing help and results directly within R. I do miss looping as it is not effecient in R as it is in other software. Personally, I found R far easier to learn and use than other software.
