For the second project we created an .Rmd file that would automatically generate 6 reports from the online news popularity data set.
The most difficult part of this project was the knitting of the documents using an automated method. Given the amount of time it took to create
each document there was not a lot of room for repeated testing, so finding all of the problems in one step was very important. Next time I would 
likely test the automation of the documents in a completly different .Rmd file and then migrate the completed code over. My biggest take away 
from this project is that a quality CPU is a good investment when doing some of the computationally intense methods, and caching the results can 
help with processing time.
