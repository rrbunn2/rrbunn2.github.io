what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do
what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

Looking back on my initial blog post I don't think I would necessarily change anything, but I would say that data science is not a concrete field of work. That is to say that there is often not a single correct method to answer a question, but multiple methods which have benefits and draw backs. A data scientist must deciede which method they think will work best based upon the situation and their preferences for various benefits. My current thoughs on using R for data science are very positive. I went into the course with a bit of experience with R and now I feel even more comfortable with using R effectivly. I will probably continue to use R going forward as long as I am not required to use a different programming language. In the future, I will try to be better about adding comments to my code and utilizing vectorized functions over for loops.
