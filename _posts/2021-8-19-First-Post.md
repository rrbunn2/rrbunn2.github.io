What do you think being a data scientist is about?  What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

Being a data scientist is about mastering and utilizing skills from several related fields to answer questions and make predictions. Data science seems to be the culmination of statistics, programming, and mathematics as well as the field in which a data scientist intends to answer questions. The major duties of a data scientist are to utilize large volumes of data to create several models and then of those models chose the one which can answer a predefined question best. From what I see data scientists and statisticians are highly related in that a data scientist will often have a strong background in statistics. The main differences arise in the methodology used to answer questions, a data scientist is usually working with larger data sets and building models while a statistician is looking at various summary statistics and statistical inference. I personally view myself as somewhere between a statistician and a data scientist. I have some background knowledge of statistics, mathematics, and machine learning; but I believe I may lack the refined computer programming abilities that would place me as a data scientist.
